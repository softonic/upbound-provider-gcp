                How the conditions list should be combined to determine if a request
                is granted this AccessLevel. If AND is used, each Condition in
                conditions must be satisfied for the AccessLevel to be applied. If
                OR is used, at least one Condition in conditions must be satisfied

                or IPv6.
                Note that for a CIDR IP address block, the specified IP address
                portion must be properly truncated (i.e. all the host bits must
                be zero) or the input is considered malformed. For example,
                "192.0.2.0/24" is accepted but "192.0.2.1/24" is not. Similarly,
                for IPv6, "2001:db8::/32" is accepted whereas "2001:db8::1/32"
                is not. The originating IP of a request must be in one of the

                of the provided members. If not specified, a request may come
                from any user (logged in/not logged in, not present in any
                groups, etc.).

                Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
                Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                themselves.
                Default value is PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR.
                Possible values are PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR and PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE.

                Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
                for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
                Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.

                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
                bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
                and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                ONE regular Service Perimeter.
                In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
                Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                themselves.
                Default value is PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR.
                Possible values are PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR and PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE.

                Proposed (or dry run) ServicePerimeter configuration.
                This configuration allows to specify and test ServicePerimeter configuration
                without enforcing actual access restrictions. Only allowed to be set when
                the useExplicitDryRunSpec flag is set.

            service_perimeters.status: |-
                -

                ServicePerimeter configuration. Specifies sets of resources,
                restricted services and access levels that determine
                perimeter content and boundaries.

                -
                (Optional)
                Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
                for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
                Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.

                must be in the same policy as this ServicePerimeter. Referencing a nonexistent
                AccessLevel will cause an error. If no AccessLevel names are listed,
                resources within the perimeter can only be accessed via Google Cloud calls
                with request origins within the perimeter.

                -
                (Optional)
                The default encryption key for all tables in the dataset. Once this property is set,
                all newly-created partitioned tables in the dataset will have encryption key set to
                this value, unless table creation request (or query) overrides the key.

            delete: '- Default is 20 minutes.'
            delete_contents_on_destroy: |-
                - (Optional) If set to true, delete all the tables in the
                dataset when destroying the resource; otherwise,
                destroying the resource will fail if tables are present.

                A hash of the resource.
            expirationMs: |-
                property in the timePartitioning
                settings set to this value, and changing the value will only
                affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will
                have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
                Setting this property overrides the use of defaultTableExpirationMs
                for partitioned tables: only one of defaultTableExpirationMs and
                defaultPartitionExpirationMs will be used for any new partitioned
                table. If you provide an explicit timePartitioning.expirationMs when
                creating or updating a partitioned table, that value takes precedence
                over the default partition expiration time indicated by this property.
            expirationTime: |-
                property set to the creation time plus
                the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect
                new tables, not existing ones. When the expirationTime for a given
                table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
                If a table's expirationTime is modified or removed before the
                table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when
                creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default
                expiration time indicated by this property.

                CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a 'notFound' error is returned in the job result.
                Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion

                WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data and uses the schema from the query result.
                WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table.
                WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result.
                Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully.
                Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
                Default value is WRITE_EMPTY.

            load.allow_jagged_rows: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. The missing values are treated as nulls.
                If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records,
                an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. Only applicable to CSV, ignored for other formats.
            load.allow_quoted_newlines: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file.
                The default value is false.
            load.autodetect: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates if we should automatically infer the options and schema for CSV and JSON sources.
            load.create_disposition: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported:
                CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table.
                CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a 'notFound' error is returned in the job result.
                Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion
                Default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED.
                Possible values are CREATE_IF_NEEDED and CREATE_NEVER.
            load.destination_encryption_configuration: |-
                -

            load.destination_table: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The destination table to load the data into.
                Structure is documented below.
            load.encoding: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1.
                The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data
                has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
            load.field_delimiter: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The separator for fields in a CSV file. The separator can be any ISO-8859-1 single-byte character.
                To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts
                the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the
                data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" to specify a tab separator.
                The default value is a comma (',').
            load.ignore_unknown_values: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema.
                If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records,
                and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
                The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value:
                CSV: Trailing columns
                JSON: Named values that don't match any column names
            load.json_extension: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If sourceFormat is set to newline-delimited JSON, indicates whether it should be processed as a JSON variant such as GeoJSON.
                For a sourceFormat other than JSON, omit this field. If the sourceFormat is newline-delimited JSON: - for newline-delimited
                GeoJSON: set to GEOJSON.
            load.max_bad_records: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value,
                an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.
            load.null_marker: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify "\N", BigQuery interprets "\N" as a null value
                when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an
                empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as
                an empty value.
            load.projection_fields: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If sourceFormat is set to "DATASTORE_BACKUP", indicates which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore backup.
                Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties.
                If any named property isn't found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
            load.quote: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding,
                and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.
                The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.
                If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
            load.schema_update_options: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or
                supplied in the job configuration. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND;
                when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators.
                For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified:
                ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema.
                ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.
            load.skip_leading_rows: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data.
                The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.
                When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:
                skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected,
                the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row.
                skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row.
                skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected,
                row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
            load.source_format: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The format of the data files. For CSV files, specify "CSV". For datastore backups, specify "DATASTORE_BACKUP".
                For newline-delimited JSON, specify "NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON". For Avro, specify "AVRO". For parquet, specify "PARQUET".
                For orc, specify "ORC". [Beta] For Bigtable, specify "BIGTABLE".
                The default value is CSV.
            load.source_uris: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud.
                For Google Cloud Storage URIs: Each URI can contain one '*' wildcard character
                and it must come after the 'bucket' name. Size limits related to load jobs apply
                to external data sources. For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be
                specified and it has be a fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table.
                For Google Cloud Datastore backups: Exactly one URI can be specified. Also, the '*' wildcard character is not allowed.

                (Optional)
                Time-based partitioning specification for the destination table.
                Structure is documented below.
            load.write_disposition: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported:
                WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data and uses the schema from the query result.
                WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table.
                WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result.
                Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully.
                Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
                Default value is WRITE_EMPTY.
                Possible values are WRITE_TRUNCATE, WRITE_APPEND, and WRITE_EMPTY.
            query.allow_large_results: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight cost in performance.
                Requires destinationTable to be set. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and large results are always allowed.
                However, you must still set destinationTable when result size exceeds the allowed maximum response size.
            query.create_disposition: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported:
                CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table.
                CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a 'notFound' error is returned in the job result.
                Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion
                Default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED.
                Possible values are CREATE_IF_NEEDED and CREATE_NEVER.

                This property must be set for large results that exceed the maximum response size.
                For queries that produce anonymous (cached) results, this field will be populated by BigQuery.
                Structure is documented below.
            query.flatten_results: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, flattens all nested and repeated fields in the query results.
                allowLargeResults must be true if this is set to false. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and results are never flattened.
            query.maximum_billing_tier: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Limits the billing tier for this job. Queries that have resource usage beyond this tier will fail (without incurring a charge).

                -
                (Optional)
                Whether to look for the result in the query cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed whenever
                tables in the query are modified. Moreover, the query cache is only available when a query does not have a destination table specified.
                The default value is true.

                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported:
                WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data and uses the schema from the query result.
                WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table.
                WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result.
                Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully.
                Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
                Default value is WRITE_EMPTY.
                Possible values are WRITE_TRUNCATE, WRITE_APPEND, and WRITE_EMPTY.

                indefinitely. Expired tables will be deleted and their storage
                reclaimed.
            external_data_configuration: |-
                - (Optional) Describes the data format,
                location, and other properties of a table stored outside of BigQuery.
                By defining these properties, the data source can then be queried as

                (Optional) - When set, configures hive partitioning
                support. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning -- requesting hive
                partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error, as will providing
                an invalid specification. Structure is documented below.
            external_data_configuration.ignore_unknown_values: |-
                (Optional) - Indicates if BigQuery should
                allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema.
                If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with
                extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too
                many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
                The default value is false.
            external_data_configuration.max_bad_records: |-
                (Optional) - The maximum number of bad records that
                BigQuery can ignore when reading data.
            external_data_configuration.reference_file_schema_uri: '- (Optional) When creating an external table, the user can provide a reference file with the table schema. This is enabled for the following formats: AVRO, PARQUET, ORC.'
            external_data_configuration.schema: |-
                - (Optional) A JSON schema for the external table. Schema is required
                for CSV and JSON formats if autodetect is not on. Schema is disallowed
                for Google Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Datastore backups, Avro, ORC and Parquet formats.
                ~>NOTE: Because this field expects a JSON string, any changes to the
                string will create a diff, even if the JSON itself hasn't changed.
                Furthermore drift for this field cannot not be detected because BigQuery
                only uses this schema to compute the effective schema for the table, therefore
                any changes on the configured value will force the table to be recreated.
                This schema is effectively only applied when creating a table from an external
                datasource, after creation the computed schema will be stored in

                It is recommended to leave this field unspecified since the distinction between "DEVELOPMENT" and "PRODUCTION" instances is going away,
                and all instances will become "PRODUCTION" instances. This means that new and existing "DEVELOPMENT" instances will be converted to
                "PRODUCTION" instances. It is recommended for users to use "PRODUCTION" instances in any case, since a 1-node "PRODUCTION" instance
                is functionally identical to a "DEVELOPMENT" instance, but without the accompanying restrictions.

                Returns true if the Job is currently being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state.
                When a new Job is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the Job to the desired state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, observedGeneration and latest_succeeded_execution, will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the state matches the Job, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in terminalCondition.state.
                If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: observedGeneration and generation, latest_succeeded_execution and latestCreatedExecution.
                If reconciliation failed, observedGeneration and latest_succeeded_execution will have the state of the last succeeded execution or empty for newly created Job. Additional information on the failure can be found in terminalCondition and conditions

                Returns true if the Service is currently being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state.
                When a new Service is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the Service to the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, observedGeneration, latest_ready_revison, trafficStatuses, and uri will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the serving state matches the Service, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in terminalCondition.state.
                If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: traffic and trafficStatuses, observedGeneration and generation, latestReadyRevision and latestCreatedRevision.
                If reconciliation failed, trafficStatuses, observedGeneration, and latestReadyRevision will have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for newly created Services. Additional information on the failure can be found in terminalCondition and conditions.

                (Optional)
                App instance.
                By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted.
            app_engine_routing_override.service: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                App service.

            name: |-
                -

                The queue name.

                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            rate_limits: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Rate limits for task dispatches.
                The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of:
            rate_limits.max_burst_size: |-
                -
                The max burst size.
                Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are
                in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high
                rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits
                resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.
            rate_limits.max_concurrent_dispatches: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to
                be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been
                reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of
                concurrent requests decreases.
            rate_limits.max_dispatches_per_second: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.
                If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.
            retry_config: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Settings that determine the retry behavior.
                Structure is documented below.
            retry_config.max_attempts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Number of attempts per task.
                Cloud Tasks will attempt the task maxAttempts times (that is, if
                the first attempt fails, then there will be maxAttempts - 1
                retries). Must be >= -1.
                If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick
                the default.
                -1 indicates unlimited attempts.
            retry_config.max_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and
                maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig
                specifies that the task should be retried.
            retry_config.max_doublings: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.
                A task's retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles maxDoublings times,
                then increases linearly, and finally retries retries at intervals of maxBackoff
                up to maxAttempts times.
            retry_config.max_retry_duration: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If positive, maxRetryDuration specifies the time limit for
                retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first
                attempted. Once maxRetryDuration time has passed and the task has
                been attempted maxAttempts times, no further attempts will be
                made and the task will be deleted.
                If zero, then the task age is unlimited.
            retry_config.min_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and
                maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig
                specifies that the task should be retried.
            stackdriver_logging_config: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Configuration options for writing logs to Stackdriver Logging.
                Structure is documented below.
            stackdriver_logging_config.sampling_ratio: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Specifies the fraction of operations to write to Stackdriver Logging.
                This field may contain any value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. 0.0 is the
                default and means that no operations are logged.

                Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to starting the build process.
                Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents are discarded. Global
                volume names and paths cannot conflict with the volumes defined a build step.
                Using a global volume in a build with only one step is not valid as it is indicative
                of a build request with an incorrect configuration.

                (Required)
                The branch or tag to use. Must start with "refs/" (required).
            source_to_build.repo_type: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The type of the repo, since it may not be explicit from the repo field (e.g from a URL).
                Values can be UNKNOWN, CLOUD_SOURCE_REPOSITORIES, GITHUB, BITBUCKET_SERVER
                Possible values are UNKNOWN, CLOUD_SOURCE_REPOSITORIES, GITHUB, and BITBUCKET_SERVER.
            source_to_build.uri: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The URI of the repo (required).
            step.args: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when it is started.
                If the image used to run the step's container has an entrypoint, the args
                are used as arguments to that entrypoint. If the image does not define an
                entrypoint, the first element in args is used as the entrypoint, and the
                remainder will be used as arguments.
            step.dir: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Working directory to use when running this step's container.
                If this value is a relative path, it is relative to the build's working
                directory. If this value is absolute, it may be outside the build's working
                directory, in which case the contents of the path may not be persisted
                across build step executions, unless a volume for that path is specified.
                If the build specifies a RepoSource with dir and a step with a
                dir,
                which specifies an absolute path, the RepoSource dir is ignored
                for the step's execution.
            step.entrypoint: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Entrypoint to be used instead of the build step image's
                default entrypoint.
                If unset, the image's default entrypoint is used
            step.env: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of environment variable definitions to be used when
                running a step.
                The elements are of the form "KEY=VALUE" for the environment variable
                "KEY" being given the value "VALUE".
            step.id: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Unique identifier for this build step, used in wait_for to
                reference this build step as a dependency.
            step.name: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The name of the container image that will run this particular build step.
                If the image is available in the host's Docker daemon's cache, it will be
                run directly. If not, the host will attempt to pull the image first, using
                the builder service account's credentials if necessary.
                The Docker daemon's cache will already have the latest versions of all of
                the officially supported build steps (see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders
                for images and examples).
                The Docker daemon will also have cached many of the layers for some popular
                images, like "ubuntu", "debian", but they will be refreshed at the time
                you attempt to use them.
                If you built an image in a previous build step, it will be stored in the
                host's Docker daemon's cache and is available to use as the name for a
                later build step.
            step.script: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A shell script to be executed in the step.
                When script is provided, the user cannot specify the entrypoint or args.

                (Optional)
                A list of environment variables which are encrypted using
                a Cloud Key
                Management Service crypto key. These values must be specified in
                the build's Secret.
            step.timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Time limit for executing this build step. If not defined,
                the step has no
                time limit and will be allowed to continue to run until either it
                completes or the build itself times out.
            step.timing: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                build step.
            step.volumes: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                List of volumes to mount into the build step.
                Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to execution of the
                build step. Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents
                are discarded.
                Using a named volume in only one step is not valid as it is
                indicative of a build request with an incorrect configuration.
                Structure is documented below.
            step.wait_for: |-
                -

                The ID(s) of the step(s) that this build step depends on.
                This build step will not start until all the build steps in wait_for
                have completed successfully. If wait_for is empty, this build step
                will start when all previous build steps in the Build.Steps list
                have completed successfully.

                (Required)
                The configuration parameters for the autoscaling algorithm. You can
                define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization,
                customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.
                If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based
                on cpuUtilization to 0.6 or 60%.
                Structure is documented below.
            autoscaling_policy.cooldown_period: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it
                starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents
                the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
                initializing, during which the collected usage would not be
                reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.
                Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                and time the startup process.

            metric.filter: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                is exporting per-instance or per-group data.
                You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                any functions for each selector.
                You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                be identical.
                The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                labels.
                If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.
                If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.
                You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.
            metric.name: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver Monitoring metric.
                The metric cannot have negative values.
                The metric must have a value type of INT64 or DOUBLE.
            metric.single_instance_assignment: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the
                total amount of work to be done or resource usage, set this value to
                an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                to group resizing.
                For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages
                or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to
                your instances.
                A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
                instead.
            metric.target: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The target value of the metric that autoscaler should
                maintain. This must be a positive value. A utilization
                metric scales number of virtual machines handling requests
                to increase or decrease proportionally to the metric.
                For example, a good metric to use as a utilizationTarget is
                www.googleapis.com/compute/instance/network/received_bytes_count.
                The autoscaler will work to keep this value constant for each
                of the instances.
            metric.type: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Defines how target utilization value is expressed for a
                Stackdriver Monitoring metric.
                Possible values are GAUGE, DELTA_PER_SECOND, and DELTA_PER_MINUTE.
            name: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Name of the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following

                (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION).
                Default value is 1, which means the group will serve up to 100%
                of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A
                setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering
                0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].

                are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
                For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
                endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
                located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
                Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
                Network Endpoint Group backends.
                Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint

                distributions. If the number of hosts in the load balancing pool
                is larger than the ring size, each host will be assigned a single
                virtual node.

                After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must
                provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk
                snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).
                Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
                the disk.
                If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
                the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and
                you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.

                the value must not be less than the size of the image
                or the size of the snapshot.
                ~>NOTE If you change the size, Terraform updates the disk size
                if upsizing is detected but recreates the disk if downsizing is requested.
                You can add lifecycle.prevent_destroy in the config to prevent destroying

                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following

                Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both
                inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative
                priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of
                priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has
                higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take
                precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.

                If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to
                traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must
                be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
                sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will
                apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
                source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The
                connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to
                apply. Only IPv4 is supported. For INGRESS traffic, one of source_ranges,
                source_tags or source_service_accounts is required.
            source_service_accounts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only
                to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this
                list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an
                instance's external IP address because service accounts are associated
                with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the
                same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will
                apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
                source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in
                sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both
                properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be
                used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags. For INGRESS traffic,
                one of source_ranges, source_tags or source_service_accounts is required.
            source_tags: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic
                with source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags. Source
                tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
                address. Because tags are associated with an instance, not an IP
                address. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
                both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has
                source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to
                a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need
                to match both properties for the firewall to apply. For INGRESS traffic,
                one of source_ranges, source_tags or source_service_accounts is required.

                targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or
                sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are
                specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified
                network.

                This field can be used with internal load balancer or network load balancer
                when the forwarding rule references a backend service, or with the target
                field when it references a TargetInstance. Set this to true to
                allow packets addressed to any ports to be forwarded to the backends configured
                with this forwarding rule. This can be used when the protocol is TCP/UDP, and it
                must be set to true when the protocol is set to L3_DEFAULT.
                Cannot be set if port or portRange are set.

            ip_address: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
                traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
                the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
                loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
                type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
                to IP address specifications.
                An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
                reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
                reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
                The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
                that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
                For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
                Google APIs, IP address must be provided.

                -
                (Optional)
                The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
                When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are
                valid.
                Possible values are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP, and L3_DEFAULT.
            is_mirroring_collector: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used
                as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
                instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic
                mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This
                can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
                loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.

            load_balancing_scheme: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be
                EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
                Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
                and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
                INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
                and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
                EXTERNAL_MANAGED is used for regional external HTTP(S) load balancers.
                INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.
                (Beta only) Note: This field must be set to ""
                if the target is an URI of a service attachment.
                Default value is EXTERNAL.

                Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.

                -
                (Optional)
                This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
                TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
                TargetPool, TargetInstance.
                Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
                addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
                Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
                disjoint port ranges.
                Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
                ports:
            ports: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This field is used along with internal load balancing and network
                load balancer when the forwarding rule references a backend service
                and when protocol is not L3_DEFAULT.
                A single port or a comma separated list of ports can be configured.
                Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the backends
                configured with this forwarding rule.
                You can only use one of ports and portRange, or allPorts.
                The three are mutually exclusive.
                You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports, which can be non-contiguous.

                -
                (Optional)
                The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
                traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
                the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
                loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
                type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
                to IP address specifications.
                An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
                reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
                reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
                The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
                that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
                For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
                Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
            ip_protocol: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The IP protocol to which this rule applies. When the load balancing scheme is
                INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, only TCP is valid. This field must not be set if the
                global address is configured as a purpose of PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT
                and addressType of INTERNAL
                Possible values are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, and ICMP.

            labels: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
            load_balancing_scheme: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This signifies what the GlobalForwardingRule will be used for.
                The value of INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED means that this will be used for
                Internal Global HTTP(S) LB. The value of EXTERNAL means that this
                will be used for External Global Load Balancing (HTTP(S) LB,
                External TCP/UDP LB, SSL Proxy). The value of EXTERNAL_MANAGED means
                that this will be used for Global external HTTP(S) load balancers.
                (Beta only) Note: This field must be set "" if the global address is
                configured as a purpose of PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT and addressType of INTERNAL.
                Default value is EXTERNAL.
                Possible values are EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, and INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
            metadata_filters: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
                configuration to a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
                requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a
                match takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made available
                to those proxies.
                For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set
                to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the
                corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria
                is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
                corresponding labels in the provided metadata.
                metadataFilters specified here can be overridden by those specified in
                the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references.
                metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their
                loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
                Structure is documented below.
            metadata_filters.filter_labels: |-
                -

                provided metadata based on filterMatchCriteria
                This list must not be empty and can have at the most 64 entries.
                Structure is documented below.
            metadata_filters.filter_match_criteria: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Specifies how individual filterLabel matches within the list of
                filterLabels contribute towards the overall metadataFilter match.
                MATCH_ANY - At least one of the filterLabels must have a matching
                label in the provided metadata.
                MATCH_ALL - All filterLabels must have matching labels in the
                provided metadata.
                Possible values are MATCH_ANY and MATCH_ALL.
            name: |-
                -

                Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.

                This field is not used for external load balancing.
                For INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, this field
                identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to
                for this global forwarding rule. If this field is not specified,
                the default network will be used.

                TargetPool, TargetInstance.
                Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
                addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
                Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
                disjoint port ranges.
                Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
                ports:
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.

            target: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.
                The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object.
                For INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, only HTTP and HTTPS targets
                are valid.
                (Beta only) For global address with a purpose of PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT and
                addressType of INTERNAL, only "all-apis" and "vpc-sc" are valid.

                list of default metadata values (e.g. ssh-keys) can be found here
            metadata_fingerprint: '- The unique fingerprint of the metadata.'
            metadata_startup_script: |-
                - (Optional) An alternative to using the
                startup-script metadata key, except this one forces the instance to be recreated
                (thus re-running the script) if it is changed. This replaces the startup-script
                metadata key on the created instance and thus the two mechanisms are not
                allowed to be used simultaneously.  Users are free to use either mechanism - the
                only distinction is that this separate attribute will cause a recreate on
                modification.  On import, metadata_startup_script will not be set - if you
                choose to specify it you will see a diff immediately after import causing a
                destroy/recreate operation. If importing an instance and specifying this value
                is desired, you will need to modify your state file manually using
                terraform state commands.

                work unless Terraform can send traffic to the instance's network (e.g. via
                tunnel or because it is running on another cloud instance on that network).

You can specify either REFRESH to update without stopping instances, RESTART to restart existing instances or REPLACE to delete and create new instances from the target template. If you specify a REFRESH, the Updater will attempt to perform that action only. However, if the Updater determines that the minimal action you specify is not enough to perform the update, it might perform a more disruptive action.'
            update_policy.most_disruptive_allowed_action: '- (Optional) - Most disruptive action that is allowed to be taken on an instance. You can specify either NONE to forbid any actions, REFRESH to allow actions that do not need instance restart, RESTART to allow actions that can be applied without instance replacing or REPLACE to allow all possible actions. If the Updater determines that the minimal update action needed is more disruptive than most disruptive allowed action you specify it will not perform the update at all.'
            update_policy.replacement_method: '- (Optional), The instance replacement method for managed instance groups. Valid values are: "RECREATE", "SUBSTITUTE". If SUBSTITUTE (default), the group replaces VM instances with new instances that have randomly generated names. If RECREATE, instance names are preserved.  You must also set max_unavailable_fixed or max_unavailable_percent to be greater than 0.'
            update_policy.type: '- (Required) - The type of update process. You can specify either PROACTIVE so that the instance group manager proactively executes actions in order to bring instances to their target versions or OPPORTUNISTIC so that no action is proactively executed but the update will be performed as part of other actions (for example, resizes or recreateInstances calls).'

                - (Required) Application versions managed by this instance group. Each
                version deals with a specific instance template, allowing canary release scenarios.
                Structure is documented below.
            version.instance_template: '- (Required) - The full URL to an instance template from which all new instances of this version will be created.'
            version.name: '- (Required) - Version name.'

            version_target.version_target: '- A bit indicating whether version target has been reached in this managed instance group, i.e. all instances are in their target version. Instances'' target version are specified by version field on Instance Group Manager.'
            wait_for_instances: |-
                - (Optional) Whether to wait for all instances to be created/updated before
                returning. Note that if this is set to true and the operation does not succeed, Terraform will
                continue trying until it times out.
            wait_for_instances_status: |-
                - (Optional) When used with wait_for_instances it specifies the status to wait for.
                When STABLE is specified this resource will wait until the instances are stable before returning. When UPDATED is
                set, it will wait for the version target to be reached and any per instance configs to be effective as well as all
                instances to be stable before returning. The possible values are STABLE and UPDATED
            zone: |-

                attachment:
                NONE is the default value, which means that the attachment carries
                unencrypted traffic. VMs can send traffic to, or receive traffic
                from, this type of attachment.
                IPSEC indicates that the attachment carries only traffic encrypted by
                an IPsec device such as an HA VPN gateway. VMs cannot directly send
                traffic to, or receive traffic from, such an attachment. To use
                IPsec-encrypted Cloud Interconnect create the attachment using this
                option.
                Not currently available publicly.

                attachment, Used only for interconnect attachment that has the
                encryption option as IPSEC.
                The addresses must be RFC 1918 IP address ranges. When creating HA
                VPN gateway over the interconnect attachment, if the attachment is
                configured to use an RFC 1918 IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP
                address will be allocated from the IP address range specified
                here.
                For example, if the HA VPN gateway's interface 0 is paired to this
                interconnect attachment, then an RFC 1918 IP address for the VPN
                gateway interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address specified
                for this interconnect attachment.
                If this field is not specified for interconnect attachment that has
                encryption option as IPSEC, later on when creating HA VPN gateway on
                this interconnect attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP address will be
                allocated from regional external IP address pool.

                The configuration parameters for the autoscaling algorithm. You can
                define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization,
                customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.
                If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based
                on cpuUtilization to 0.6 or 60%.

                The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it
                starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents
                the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
                initializing, during which the collected usage would not be
                reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.
                Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                and time the startup process.

            metric.filter: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                is exporting per-instance or per-group data.
                You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                any functions for each selector.
                You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                be identical.
                The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                labels.
                If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.
                If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.
                You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.
            metric.name: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver Monitoring metric.
                The metric cannot have negative values.
                The metric must have a value type of INT64 or DOUBLE.
            metric.single_instance_assignment: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the
                total amount of work to be done or resource usage, set this value to
                an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                to group resizing.
                For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages
                or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to
                your instances.
                A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
                instead.
            metric.target: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The target value of the metric that autoscaler should
                maintain. This must be a positive value. A utilization
                metric scales number of virtual machines handling requests
                to increase or decrease proportionally to the metric.
                For example, a good metric to use as a utilizationTarget is
                www.googleapis.com/compute/instance/network/received_bytes_count.
                The autoscaler will work to keep this value constant for each
                of the instances.

                The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
                of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
                instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
                the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
                are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
                For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
                endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
                located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
                Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
                Network Endpoint Group backends.
                When the load_balancing_scheme is INTERNAL, only instance groups
                are supported.
                Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
                partial URL.

                Specifies connection persistence when backends are unhealthy.
                If set to DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL, the existing connections persist on
                unhealthy backends only for connection-oriented protocols (TCP and SCTP)
                and only if the Tracking Mode is PER_CONNECTION (default tracking mode)
                or the Session Affinity is configured for 5-tuple. They do not persist
                for UDP.
                If set to NEVER_PERSIST, after a backend becomes unhealthy, the existing
                connections on the unhealthy backend are never persisted on the unhealthy
                backend. They are always diverted to newly selected healthy backends
                (unless all backends are unhealthy).
                If set to ALWAYS_PERSIST, existing connections always persist on
                unhealthy backends regardless of protocol and session affinity. It is
                generally not recommended to use this mode overriding the default.
                Default value is DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL.
                Possible values are DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL, NEVER_PERSIST, and ALWAYS_PERSIST.

                Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
                affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
                policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
                destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
                destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
                hashing.
                This field only applies when all of the following are true -
            consistent_hash.http_cookie: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Hash is based on HTTP Cookie. This field describes a HTTP cookie
                that will be used as the hash key for the consistent hash load
                balancer. If the cookie is not present, it will be generated.
                This field is applicable if the sessionAffinity is set to HTTP_COOKIE.
                Structure is documented below.
            consistent_hash.http_header_name: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The hash based on the value of the specified header field.
                This field is applicable if the sessionAffinity is set to HEADER_FIELD.
            consistent_hash.minimum_ring_size: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The minimum number of virtual nodes to use for the hash ring.
                Larger ring sizes result in more granular load
                distributions. If the number of hosts in the load balancing pool
                is larger than the ring size, each host will be assigned a single
                virtual node.

                -
                (Optional)
                On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection drain
                will be honored. Setting this to true has the following effect: connections
                to the old active pool are not drained. Connections to the new active pool
                use the timeout of 10 min (currently fixed). Setting to false has the
                following effect: both old and new connections will have a drain timeout
                of 10 min.
                This can be set to true only if the protocol is TCP.
                The default is false.

                -
                (Optional)
                This option is used only when no healthy VMs are detected in the primary
                and backup instance groups. When set to true, traffic is dropped. When
                set to false, new connections are sent across all VMs in the primary group.
                The default is false.
            failover_policy.failover_ratio: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. If the ratio of the healthy
                VMs in the primary backend is at or below this number, traffic arriving
                at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the failover backend.
                In case where 'failoverRatio' is not set or all the VMs in the backup
                backend are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary
                backend in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy
                VMs with the best effort, or to all VMs when no VM is healthy.
                This field is only used with l4 load balancing.

                the disk.
                If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
                the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and

                persistent disk.
                If you specify this field along with sourceImage or sourceSnapshot,
                the value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage
                or the size of the snapshot.
            snapshot: |-
                -

                The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as
                a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are
                valid values:
            source_disk: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The source disk used to create this disk. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource.

                -
                The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value
                identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent
                disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot
                that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was

                URL mask allows for routing to multiple App Engine services without
                having to create multiple Network Endpoint Groups and backend services.
                For example, the request URLs "foo1-dot-appname.appspot.com/v1" and
                "foo1-dot-appname.appspot.com/v2" can be backed by the same Serverless NEG with
                URL mask "-dot-appname.appspot.com/". The URL mask will parse

                For example, request URLs "mydomain.com/function1" and "mydomain.com/function2"
                can be backed by the same Serverless NEG with URL mask "/". The URL mask
                will parse them to { function = "function1" } and { function = "function2" } respectively.

                -
                (Optional)
                A template to parse service and tag fields from a request URL.
                URL mask allows for routing to multiple Run services without having
                to create multiple network endpoint groups and backend services.
                For example, request URLs "foo1.domain.com/bar1" and "foo1.domain.com/bar2"
                an be backed by the same Serverless Network Endpoint Group (NEG) with
                URL mask ".domain.com/". The URL mask will parse them to { service="bar1", tag="foo1" }

            default_route_action: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
                Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set.
                URL maps for Classic external HTTP(S) load balancers only support the urlRewrite action within defaultRouteAction.
                defaultRouteAction has no effect when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.

            default_route_action.fault_injection_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the resiliency of clients to backend service failure.
                As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a percentage of requests before sending those requests to the backend service.
                Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load balancer for a percentage of requests.
                timeout and retryPolicy is ignored by clients that are configured with a faultInjectionPolicy if: 1. The traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault injection is not a delay fault injection.
                Fault injection is not supported with the global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic). To see which load balancers support fault injection, see Load balancing: Routing and traffic management features.
                Structure is documented below.
            default_route_action.request_mirror_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the route's backends are shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service.
                The load balancer does not wait for responses from the shadow service. Before sending traffic to the shadow service, the host / authority header is suffixed with -shadow.
                Not supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.
                Structure is documented below.
            default_route_action.retry_policy: |-
                -

                Structure is documented below.
            default_route_action.timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time the request has been fully processed (known as end-of-stream) up until the response has been processed. Timeout includes all retries.
                If not specified, this field uses the largest timeout among all backend services associated with the route.
                Not supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
                Structure is documented below.

                The spec to modify the URL of the request, before forwarding the request to the matched service.
                urlRewrite is the only action supported in UrlMaps for external HTTP(S) load balancers.
                Not supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.
                Structure is documented below.
            default_route_action.weighted_backend_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend service, there must be one weightedBackendService with weight set to a non-zero number.
                After a backend service is identified and before forwarding the request to the backend service, advanced routing actions such as URL rewrites and header transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this HttpRouteAction.
                Structure is documented below.
            default_service: |-
                -

                The full or partial URL of the defaultService resource to which traffic is directed if
                none of the hostRules match. If defaultRouteAction is additionally specified, advanced
                routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending the request to the
                backend. However, if defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
                weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
                weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified.  Only one of defaultService,
                defaultUrlRedirect or defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
            default_url_redirect: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                When none of the specified hostRules match, the request is redirected to a URL specified
                by defaultUrlRedirect. If defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService or
                defaultRouteAction must not be set.

            default_url_redirect.host_redirect: |-
                -

                A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
                occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
                corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend
                service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
                number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
                the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header
                transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this

                -
                (Required)
                For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                that matches the request is applied.
                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                2147483647 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                future without any impact on existing rules.

                A list of public visible licenses that apply to this snapshot. This
                can be because the original image had licenses attached (such as a
                Windows image).  snapshotEncryptionKey nested object Encrypts the

                Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.

                -
                (Optional)
                Encrypts the snapshot using a customer-supplied encryption key.
                After you encrypt a snapshot using a customer-supplied key, you must
                provide the same key if you use the snapshot later. For example, you
                must provide the encryption key when you create a disk from the
                encrypted snapshot in a future request.
                Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
                the snapshot.
                If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the snapshot,
                then the snapshot will be encrypted using an automatically generated
                key and you do not need to provide a key to use the snapshot later.

                The access type of IPv6 address this subnet holds. It's immutable and can only be specified during creation
                or the first time the subnet is updated into IPV4_IPV6 dual stack. If the ipv6_type is EXTERNAL then this subnet
                cannot enable direct path.
                Possible values are EXTERNAL and INTERNAL.
            ipv6_cidr_range: |-

                interval time will reduce the amount of generated flow logs for long
                lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds per connection.
                Default value is INTERVAL_5_SEC.
                Possible values are INTERVAL_5_SEC, INTERVAL_30_SEC, INTERVAL_1_MIN, INTERVAL_5_MIN, INTERVAL_10_MIN, and INTERVAL_15_MIN.

                the urlMap may be accessed by gRPC applications without using
                a sidecar proxy. This will enable configuration checks on urlMap

                A gRPC application must use "xds:///" scheme in the target URI

                (Optional)
                defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions
                like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the request to the selected backend.
                If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if defaultService
                is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
                Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set.

            default_route_action.fault_injection_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the resiliency of clients to backend service failure.
                As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by Loadbalancer on a
                percentage of requests before sending those request to the backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted
                by the Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests.
                timeout and retryPolicy will be ignored by clients that are configured with a faultInjectionPolicy.
                Structure is documented below.
            default_route_action.request_mirror_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the route's backends are shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service.
                Loadbalancer does not wait for responses from the shadow service. Prior to sending traffic to the shadow service,
                the host / authority header is suffixed with -shadow.
                Structure is documented below.
            default_route_action.retry_policy: |-
                -

            default_route_action.timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time the request has been
                fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until the response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all retries.
                If not specified, will use the largest timeout among all backend services associated with the route.
                Structure is documented below.
            default_route_action.url_rewrite: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                Structure is documented below.
            default_route_action.weighted_backend_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match occurs.
                The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their corresponding backend service.
                If all traffic needs to go to a single backend service, there must be one weightedBackendService
                with weight set to a non 0 number.
                Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to the backend service,
                advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header transformations are applied depending on
                additional settings specified in this HttpRouteAction.
                Structure is documented below.
            default_service: |-

                (Optional)
                When none of the specified hostRules match, the request is redirected to a URL specified
                by defaultUrlRedirect. If defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService or
                defaultRouteAction must not be set.

            default_url_redirect.https_redirect: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If set to true, the URL scheme in the redirected request is set to https. If set to
                false, the URL scheme of the redirected request will remain the same as that of the
                request. This must only be set for UrlMaps used in TargetHttpProxys. Setting this
                true for TargetHttpsProxy is not permitted. The default is set to false.

                The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the
                resiliency of clients to backend service failure. As part of fault injection,
                when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by
                Loadbalancer on a percentage of requests before sending those request to the
                backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the
                Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy will be
                ignored by clients that are configured with a fault_injection_policy.

                the request is has been fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until the
                response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all retries. If not
                specified, the default value is 15 seconds.

            route_action.weighted_backend_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
                occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
                corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend
                service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
                number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
                the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header
                transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this
                HttpRouteAction.

            route_rules.priority: |-
                -
                (Required)
                For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                that matches the request is applied.
                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                2147483647 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                future without any impact on existing rules.

                -
                (Optional)
                In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer performs advanced routing
                actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
                request to the selected backend. If  routeAction specifies any
                weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely if service is set,
                routeAction cannot contain any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction
                or urlRedirect must be set.

                directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is additionally specified,
                advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending
                the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
                contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
                weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect,
                service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.

                Note kind that represents a logical attestation "role" or "authority".
                For example, an organization might have one AttestationAuthority for
                "QA" and one for "build". This Note is intended to act strictly as a
                grouping mechanism for the attached Occurrences (Attestations). This
                grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs
                gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given
                Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
                Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same
                project.

                This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of
                the AttestationAuthority. Because the name of a Note acts as its
                resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical
                name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes)
                from "readable" names more suitable for debug output. Note that
                these hints should NOT be used to look up AttestationAuthorities
                in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up
                Attestations to verify.

            min_master_version: |-
                - (Optional) The minimum version of the master. GKE
                will auto-update the master to new versions, so this does not guarantee the
                current master version--use the read-only master_version field to obtain that.
                If unset, the cluster's version will be set by GKE to the version of the most recent
                official release (which is not necessarily the latest version).  Most users will find
                the google_container_engine_versions data source useful - it indicates which versions
                are available, and can be use to approximate fuzzy versions in a
                Terraform-compatible way. If you intend to specify versions manually,
                the docs
                describe the various acceptable formats for this field.

                the cluster. From GKE 1.12 onwards, disable-legacy-endpoints is set to
                true by the API; if metadata is set but that default value is not
                included, Terraform will attempt to unset the value. To avoid this, set the
                value in your config.
            node_config.min_cpu_platform: |-
                - (Optional) Minimum CPU platform to be used by this instance.

                - (Optional) A boolean that represents whether or not the underlying node VMs
                are preemptible. See the official documentation
                for more information. Defaults to false.

                - (Optional) A list of Kubernetes taints
                to apply to nodes. GKE's API can only set this field on cluster creation.
                However, GKE will add taints to your nodes if you enable certain features such
                as GPUs. If this field is set, any diffs on this field will cause Terraform to
                recreate the underlying resource. Taint values can be updated safely in
                Kubernetes (eg. through kubectl), and it's recommended that you do not use
                this field to manage taints. If you do, lifecycle.ignore_changes is
                recommended. Structure is documented below.
            node_config.workload_metadata_config: |-
                - (Optional) Metadata configuration to expose to workloads on the node pool.

                are located. Nodes must be in the region of their regional cluster or in the
                same region as their cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If this is specified for
                a zonal cluster, omit the cluster's zone.
            node_pool: |-
                - (Optional) List of node pools associated with this cluster.
                See google_container_node_pool for schema.
                Warning: node pools defined inside a cluster can't be changed (or added/removed) after
                cluster creation without deleting and recreating the entire cluster. Unless you absolutely need the ability
                to say "these are the only node pools associated with this cluster", use the
                google_container_node_pool resource instead of this property.
            node_pool_auto_config: |-
                - (Optional, Beta) Node pool configs that apply to auto-provisioned node pools in

            node_version: |-
                - (Optional) The Kubernetes version on the nodes. Must either be unset
                or set to the same value as min_master_version on create. Defaults to the default
                version set by GKE which is not necessarily the latest version. This only affects
                nodes in the default node pool. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
                recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
                when fuzzy versions are used. See the google_container_engine_versions data source's
                version_prefix field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.

                (Optional) - Enables the private cluster feature,
                creating a private endpoint on the cluster. In a private cluster, nodes only
                have RFC 1918 private addresses and communicate with the master's private
                endpoint via private networking.
            private_cluster_config.master_global_access_config: |-
                (Optional) - Controls cluster master global
                access settings. If unset, Terraform will no longer manage this field and will
                not modify the previously-set value. Structure is documented below.

                with any other ranges in use within the cluster's network, and it must be a /28
                subnet. See Private Cluster Limitations
                for more details. This field only applies to private clusters, when
                enable_private_nodes is true.

                feature, which provide more control over automatic upgrades of your GKE clusters.
                When updating this field, GKE imposes specific version requirements. See
                Selecting a new release channel
                for more details; the google_container_engine_versions datasource can provide
                the default version for a channel. Note that removing the release_channel
                field from your config will cause Terraform to stop managing your cluster's
                release channel, but will not unenroll it. Instead, use the "UNSPECIFIED"
                channel. Structure is documented below.

                - (Optional)
                The list of zones in which the node pool's nodes should be located. Nodes must
                be in the region of their regional cluster or in the same region as their
                cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If unspecified, the cluster-level

                - (Required) The type of the policy. Supports a single value: COMPACT.
                Specifying COMPACT placement policy type places node pool's nodes in a closer
                physical proximity in order to reduce network latency between nodes.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which to create the node pool. If blank,
                the provider-configured project will be used.

            upgrade_settings.blue_green_settings: |-
                - (Optional) The settings to adjust blue green upgrades.
                Structure is documented below
            upgrade_settings.max_surge: |-
                - (Optional) The number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool during
                an upgrade. Increasing max_surge raises the number of nodes that can be upgraded simultaneously.
                Can be set to 0 or greater.
            upgrade_settings.max_unavailable: |-
                - (Optional) The number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable during
                an upgrade. Increasing max_unavailable raises the number of nodes that can be upgraded in
                parallel. Can be set to 0 or greater.
            upgrade_settings.strategy: '- (Default SURGE) The upgrade stragey to be used for upgrading the nodes.'
            version: |-
                - (Optional) The Kubernetes version for the nodes in this pool. Note that if this field
                and auto_upgrade are both specified, they will fight each other for what the node version should
                be, so setting both is highly discouraged. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
                recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
                when fuzzy versions are used. See the google_container_engine_versions data source's
                version_prefix field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.

                This maps the ID of a tag field to the value of and additional information about that field.
                Valid field IDs are defined by the tag's template. A tag must have at least 1 field and at most 500 fields.
                Structure is documented below.
            fields.bool_value: |-
                -

                -
                (Optional)
                Resources like Entry can have schemas associated with them. This scope allows users to attach tags to an
                individual column based on that schema.
                For attaching a tag to a nested column, use . to separate the column names. Example:
                outer_column.inner_column

            fields.order: |-
                -
                The order of this field with respect to other fields in this tag. For example, a higher value can indicate
                a more important field. The value can be negative. Multiple fields can have the same order, and field orders
                within a tag do not have to be sequential.
            fields.parent: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The name of the parent this tag is attached to. This can be the name of an entry or an entry group. If an entry group, the tag will be attached to
                all entries in that group.
            fields.string_value: |-
                -

                projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/entrygroups/{entryGroupId}/entries/{entryId}/tags/{tag_id} or
                projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/entrygroups/{entryGroupId}/tags/{tag_id}
                where tag_id is a system-generated identifier. Note that this Tag may not actually be stored in the location in this name.

                The custom info type to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom info type followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: {info type name}({surrogate character count}):{surrogate}
                For example, if the name of custom info type is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc'
                This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom info type 'Surrogate'. This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.
                Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text.

                (Optional)
                The custom infoType to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: info_type_name(surrogate_character_count):surrogate
                For example, if the name of custom infoType is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc'
                This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom infoType SurrogateType. This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.
                In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

            field_transformations.fields: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Input field(s) to apply the transformation to. When you have columns that reference their position within a list, omit the index from the FieldId.
                FieldId name matching ignores the index. For example, instead of "contact.nums[0].type", use "contact.nums.type".
                Structure is documented below.

                This can be used on data of type: number, long, string, timestamp.
                If the provided value type differs from the type of data being transformed, we will first attempt converting the type of the data to be transformed to match the type of the bound before comparing.

                Replaces an identifier with a surrogate using Format Preserving Encryption (FPE) with the FFX mode of operation; however when used in the content.reidentify API method, it serves the opposite function by reversing the surrogate back into the original identifier. The identifier must be encoded as ASCII. For a given crypto key and context, the same identifier will be replaced with the same surrogate. Identifiers must be at least two characters long. In the case that the identifier is the empty string, it will be skipped. See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/pseudonymization to learn more.
                Note: We recommend using CryptoDeterministicConfig for all use cases which do not require preserving the input alphabet space and size, plus warrant referential integrity.

                (Optional)
                Buckets values based on fixed size ranges. The Bucketing transformation can provide all of this functionality, but requires more configuration. This message is provided as a convenience to the user for simple bucketing strategies.
                The transformed value will be a hyphenated string of {lower_bound}-{upper_bound}. For example, if lower_bound = 10 and upper_bound = 20, all values that are within this bucket will be replaced with "10-20".
                This can be used on data of type: double, long.
                If the bound Value type differs from the type of data being transformed, we will first attempt converting the type of the data to be transformed to match the type of the bound before comparing.

                Default value is POSSIBLE.
                Possible values are VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, and VERY_LIKELY.
            inspect_config.rule_set: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Set of rules to apply to the findings for this InspectConfig. Exclusion rules, contained in the set are executed in the end,
                other rules are executed in the order they are specified for each info type.
                Structure is documented below.
            likelihood_adjustment.fixed_likelihood: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Set the likelihood of a finding to a fixed value. Either this or relative_likelihood can be set.
                Possible values are VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, and VERY_LIKELY.
            likelihood_adjustment.relative_likelihood: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Increase or decrease the likelihood by the specified number of levels. For example,
                if a finding would be POSSIBLE without the detection rule and relativeLikelihood is 1,
                then it is upgraded to LIKELY, while a value of -1 would downgrade it to UNLIKELY.
                Likelihood may never drop below VERY_UNLIKELY or exceed VERY_LIKELY, so applying an
                adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is VERY_LIKELY
                will result in a final likelihood of LIKELY. Either this or fixed_likelihood can be set.

            secondary_worker_config.weight: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Weight for the instance group, which is used to determine the fraction of total workers
                in the cluster from this instance group. For example, if primary workers have weight 2,
                and secondary workers have weight 1, the cluster will have approximately 2 primary workers
                for each secondary worker.
                The cluster may not reach the specified balance if constrained by min/max bounds or other
                autoscaling settings. For example, if maxInstances for secondary workers is 0, then only
                primary workers will be added. The cluster can also be out of balance when created.
                If weight is not set on any instance group, the cluster will default to equal weight for
                all groups: the cluster will attempt to maintain an equal number of workers in each group
                within the configured size bounds for each group. If weight is set for one group only,
                the cluster will default to zero weight on the unset group. For example if weight is set
                only on primary workers, the cluster will use primary workers only and no secondary workers.

                Weight for the instance group, which is used to determine the fraction of total workers
                in the cluster from this instance group. For example, if primary workers have weight 2,
                and secondary workers have weight 1, the cluster will have approximately 2 primary workers
                for each secondary worker.
                The cluster may not reach the specified balance if constrained by min/max bounds or other

                duration to wait for jobs to complete before forcefully removing workers
                (and potentially interrupting jobs). Only applicable to downscaling operations.
                Bounds: [0s, 1d].
            yarn_config.scale_down_factor: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to
                remove workers. A scale-down factor of 1 will result in scaling down so that there
                is no available memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling).
                A scale-down factor of 0 disables removing workers, which can be beneficial for
                autoscaling a single job.
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0].
            yarn_config.scale_down_min_worker_fraction: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Minimum scale-down threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs.
                For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must
                recommend at least a 2 worker scale-down for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0
                means the autoscaler will scale down on any recommended change.
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0]. Default: 0.0.
            yarn_config.scale_up_factor: |-

                Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to
                add workers. A scale-up factor of 1.0 will result in scaling up so that there
                is no pending memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling).
                A scale-up factor closer to 0 will result in a smaller magnitude of scaling up
                (less aggressive scaling).
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0].

                Minimum scale-up threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling
                occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler
                must recommend at least a 2-worker scale-up for the cluster to scale. A threshold of
                0 means the autoscaler will scale up on any recommended change.
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0]. Default: 0.0.

                If set to true, a deployment is created with "shell" resources
                that are not actually instantiated. This allows you to preview a
                deployment. It can be updated to false to actually deploy
                with real resources.
                ~>NOTE: Deployment Manager does not allow update
                of a deployment in preview (unless updating to preview=false). Thus,
                Terraform will force-recreate deployments if either preview is updated

                A flow's event handlers serve two purposes:
                They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow.
                They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
                Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.

                A flow's transition routes serve two purposes:
                They are responsible for matching the user's first utterances in the flow.
                They are inherited by every page's [transition routes][Page.transition_routes] and can support use cases such as the user saying "help" or "can I talk to a human?", which can be handled in a common way regardless of the current page. Transition routes defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
                TransitionRoutes are evalauted in the following order:
                TransitionRoutes with intent specified.
                TransitionRoutes with only condition specified.
                TransitionRoutes with intent specified are inherited by pages in the flow.

                The ordered list of training phrase parts. The parts are concatenated in order to form the training phrase.
                Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does.
                Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated.
                If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set.
                If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways:
                Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters.
                Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the parameterId field is set.

                Whether Dialogflow should return currently queued fulfillment response messages in streaming APIs. If a webhook is specified, it happens before Dialogflow invokes webhook. Warning: 1) This flag only affects streaming API. Responses are still queued and returned once in non-streaming API. 2) The flag can be enabled in any fulfillment but only the first 3 partial responses will be returned. You may only want to apply it to fulfillments that have slow webhooks.

                etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous
                updates of a backup plan from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that
                systems make use of the 'etag' in the read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupPlan updates
                in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to backupPlans.get,
                and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to backupPlans.patch or
                backupPlans.delete to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource.

                will automatically pick up the new value.
                NOTE: backupRetainDays must be >= backupDeleteLockDays.

                Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store
                creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API will enforce referential integrity and fail the
                requests that will result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API
                will skip referential integrity check. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as
                Patient.get$everything, will not return all the results if broken references exist.

                of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations will cause historical
                versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but
                cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions will be kept. The server will send back errors for
                attempts to read the historical versions.

                versions into the FHIR store. Importing resource histories creates resource interactions that appear to have

                -
                (Optional)
                A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in
                this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next
                resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed
                from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required
                bigquery.dataEditor role to your project's Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account. Some lag (typically on
                the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
                Structure is documented below.
            stream_configs.bigquery_destination: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config.
                The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that
                are named after the resource types, e.g. "Patient", "Observation". When there is no existing table for a given
                resource type, the server attempts to create one.
                See the streaming config reference for more details.
                Structure is documented below.

                an empty list as an intent to stream all the supported resource types in this FHIR store.

                The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters.
                If unspecified, all valid authentication credentials will be accepted.
                The following example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped google.groups value of admins:

                principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/{location}/workforcePools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}
                Each value must be a Common Expression Language
                function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified
                by the corresponding map key.
                You can use the assertion keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of
                the authentication credential issued by the provider.
                The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated,
                the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB.
                For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping that includes the google.subject attribute.
                For example, the following maps the sub claim of the incoming credential to the subject attribute
                on a Google token:
            attribute_condition: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A Common Expression Language expression, in
                plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication credentials issued by the
                provider should not be accepted.
                The expression must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation.
                The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions:
            attribute_mapping: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Maps attributes from the authentication credentials issued by an external identity provider
                to Google Cloud attributes, such as subject and segment.
                Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to.
                The following keys are supported:
            create: '- Default is 20 minutes.'
            delete: '- Default is 20 minutes.'

                : The name of the authenticated user. This is an optional field and
                the mapped display name cannot exceed 100 bytes. If not set, google.subject will be displayed instead.
                This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings.
            google.groups: |-
                : Groups the authenticating user belongs to. You can grant groups access to
                resources using an IAM principalSet binding; access applies to all members of the group.

                This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings.
                You can also provide custom attributes by specifying attribute.{custom_attribute}, where {custom_attribute}
                is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes.
                The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_].
                You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workforce pool
                to Google Cloud resources. For example:
            google.subject: |-
                : The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value in IAM bindings.

                You can also provide custom attributes by specifying attribute.{custom_attribute},
                where {custom_attribute} is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can
                define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key
                is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_].
                You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a
                workload to Google Cloud resources. For example:
            google.subject: |-
                : The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value
                in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs.
                Cannot exceed 127 characters.
            id: '- an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{{workload_identity_pool_id}}/providers/{{workload_identity_pool_provider_id}}'
            name: |-
                -
                The resource name of the provider as
                projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{workload_identity_pool_id}/providers/{workload_identity_pool_provider_id}.
            oidc: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                An OpenId Connect 1.0 identity provider. Not compatible with the property aws.
                Structure is documented below.
            oidc.allowed_audiences: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Acceptable values for the aud field (audience) in the OIDC token. Token exchange
                requests are rejected if the token audience does not match one of the configured
                values. Each audience may be at most 256 characters. A maximum of 10 audiences may
                be configured.
                If this list is empty, the OIDC token audience must be equal to the full canonical
                resource name of the WorkloadIdentityPoolProvider, with or without the HTTPS prefix.
                For example:
            oidc.issuer_uri: |-

                A valueExtractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to
                record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction - EXTRACT(field) or
                REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are 1. field - The name of the log entry field from which
                the value is to be extracted. 2. regex - A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax
                (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified
                log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an
                error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.

                By default, Logging creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g. syslog_20170523. With partitioned
                tables the date suffix is no longer present and special query syntax
                has to be used instead. In both cases, tables are sharded based on UTC timezone.

                then a unique service account is created and used for this sink. If you wish to publish logs across projects or utilize
                bigquery_options, you must set unique_writer_identity to true.

                The alignment period for per-time
                series alignment. If present,
                alignmentPeriod must be at least
                60 seconds. After per-time series
                alignment, each time series will
                contain data points only on the
                period boundaries. If
                perSeriesAligner is not specified
                or equals ALIGN_NONE, then this
                field is ignored. If
                perSeriesAligner is specified and
                does not equal ALIGN_NONE, then
                this field must be defined;
                otherwise an error is returned.
            aggregations.cross_series_reducer: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The approach to be used to combine
                time series. Not all reducer
                functions may be applied to all
                time series, depending on the
                metric type and the value type of
                the original time series.
                Reduction may change the metric
                type of value type of the time
                series.Time series data must be
                aligned in order to perform cross-
                time series reduction. If
                crossSeriesReducer is specified,
                then perSeriesAligner must be
                specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE
                and alignmentPeriod must be
                specified; otherwise, an error is
                returned.
                Possible values are REDUCE_NONE, REDUCE_MEAN, REDUCE_MIN, REDUCE_MAX, REDUCE_SUM, REDUCE_STDDEV, REDUCE_COUNT, REDUCE_COUNT_TRUE, REDUCE_COUNT_FALSE, REDUCE_FRACTION_TRUE, REDUCE_PERCENTILE_99, REDUCE_PERCENTILE_95, REDUCE_PERCENTILE_50, and REDUCE_PERCENTILE_05.
            aggregations.group_by_fields: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The set of fields to preserve when
                crossSeriesReducer is specified.
                The groupByFields determine how
                the time series are partitioned
                into subsets prior to applying the
                aggregation function. Each subset
                contains time series that have the
                same value for each of the
                grouping fields. Each individual
                time series is a member of exactly
                one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                is applied to each subset of time
                series. It is not possible to
                reduce across different resource
                types, so this field implicitly
                contains resource.type. Fields not
                specified in groupByFields are
                aggregated away. If groupByFields
                is not specified and all the time
                series have the same resource
                type, then the time series are
                aggregated into a single output
                time series. If crossSeriesReducer
                is not defined, this field is
                ignored.
            aggregations.per_series_aligner: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The approach to be used to align
                individual time series. Not all
                alignment functions may be applied
                to all time series, depending on
                the metric type and value type of
                the original time series.
                Alignment may change the metric
                type or the value type of the time
                series.Time series data must be
                aligned in order to perform cross-
                time series reduction. If
                crossSeriesReducer is specified,
                then perSeriesAligner must be
                specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE
                and alignmentPeriod must be
                specified; otherwise, an error is
                returned.
                Possible values are ALIGN_NONE, ALIGN_DELTA, ALIGN_RATE, ALIGN_INTERPOLATE, ALIGN_NEXT_OLDER, ALIGN_MIN, ALIGN_MAX, ALIGN_MEAN, ALIGN_COUNT, ALIGN_SUM, ALIGN_STDDEV, ALIGN_COUNT_TRUE, ALIGN_COUNT_FALSE, ALIGN_FRACTION_TRUE, ALIGN_PERCENTILE_99, ALIGN_PERCENTILE_95, ALIGN_PERCENTILE_50, ALIGN_PERCENTILE_05, and ALIGN_PERCENT_CHANGE.
            alert_strategy.auto_close: |-
                -

            alert_strategy.notification_rate_limit: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                -
                (Required)
                How to combine the results of multiple conditions to
                determine if an incident should be opened.
                Possible values are AND, OR, and AND_WITH_MATCHING_RESOURCE.
            condition_absent.aggregations: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the alignment of data points in
                individual time series as well as how to
                combine the retrieved time series together
                (such as when aggregating multiple streams
                on each resource to a single stream for each
                resource or when aggregating streams across
                all members of a group of resources).
                Multiple aggregations are applied in the
                order specified.
                Structure is documented below.
            condition_absent.duration: |-

                (Required)
                The amount of time that a time series must
                fail to report new data to be considered
                failing. Currently, only values that are a
                multiple of a minute--e.g. 60s, 120s, or 300s
                --are supported.
            condition_absent.filter: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A filter that identifies which time series
                should be compared with the threshold.The
                filter is similar to the one that is
                specified in the
                MetricService.ListTimeSeries request (that
                call is useful to verify the time series
                that will be retrieved / processed) and must
                specify the metric type and optionally may
                contain restrictions on resource type,
                resource labels, and metric labels. This
                field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters
                in length.
            condition_absent.trigger: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The number/percent of time series for which
                the comparison must hold in order for the
                condition to trigger. If unspecified, then
                the condition will trigger if the comparison
                is true for any of the time series that have
                been identified by filter and aggregations.

                Documentation that is included with notifications and incidents related
                to this policy. Best practice is for the documentation to include information
                to help responders understand, mitigate, escalate, and correct the underlying
                problems detected by the alerting policy. Notification channels that have
                limited capacity might not show this documentation.
                Structure is documented below.

            condition_matched_log.label_extractors: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A map from a label key to an extractor expression, which is used to
                extract the value for this label key. Each entry in this map is
                a specification for how data should be extracted from log entries that
                match filter. Each combination of extracted values is treated as
                a separate rule for the purposes of triggering notifications.
                Label keys and corresponding values can be used in notifications
                generated by this condition.
            condition_matched_log.notification_channels: |-

                sent when incidents are opened or closed or when new violations occur
                on an already opened incident. Each element of this array corresponds
                to the name field in each of the NotificationChannel objects that are
                returned from the notificationChannels.list method. The syntax of the

                -
                (Optional)
                This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the AlertPolicy
                objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited
                to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values
                can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys

                violate the threshold to be considered
                failing. Currently, only values that are a
                multiple of a minute--e.g., 0, 60, 120, or
                300 seconds--are supported. If an invalid
                value is given, an error will be returned.
                When choosing a duration, it is useful to
                keep in mind the frequency of the underlying
                time series data (which may also be affected
                by any alignments specified in the
                aggregations field); a good duration is long
                enough so that a single outlier does not
                generate spurious alerts, but short enough
                that unhealthy states are detected and
                alerted on quickly.

                the condition will trigger if the comparison
                is true for any of the time series that have
                been identified by filter and aggregations,

                The groupByFields determine how
                the time series are partitioned
                into subsets prior to applying the
                aggregation function. Each subset
                contains time series that have the
                same value for each of the
                grouping fields. Each individual
                time series is a member of exactly
                one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                is applied to each subset of time
                series. It is not possible to
                reduce across different resource
                types, so this field implicitly
                contains resource.type. Fields not
                specified in groupByFields are

                is not specified and all the time
                series have the same resource
                type, then the time series are
                aggregated into a single output
                time series. If crossSeriesReducer

All service defined metrics must be prefixed with the service name, in the format of {service name}/{relative metric name}, such as cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/cpu/utilization. The relative metric name must have only upper and lower-case letters, digits, '/' and underscores '_' are allowed. Additionally, the maximum number of characters allowed for the relative_metric_name is 100. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com, external.googleapis.com, or logging.googleapis.com/user/.
            unit: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the
                valueType is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of
                the stored metric values.
                Different systems may scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of
                0.02KBy might be displayed as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as
                3.5MBy). However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is always in
                thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed.
                If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job,
                you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently
                1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as
                12005.
                Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you
                can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value
                12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).
                The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure standard.
                More info can be found in the API documentation
                (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors).

                permissible and required labels are specified in the
                NotificationChannelDescriptor corresponding to the type field.
                Labels with sensitive data are obfuscated by the API and therefore Terraform cannot
                determine if there are upstream changes to these fields. They can also be configured via
                the sensitive_labels block, but cannot be configured in both places.

                -
                (Optional)
                Different notification type behaviors are configured primarily using the the labels field on this
                resource. This block contains the labels which contain secrets or passwords so that they can be marked
                sensitive and hidden from plan output. The name of the field, eg: password, will be the key
                in the labels map in the api request.
                Credentials may not be specified in both locations and will cause an error. Changing from one location
                to a different credential configuration in the config will require an apply to update state.

            type: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The type of the notification channel. This field matches the value of the NotificationChannelDescriptor.type field.

                User-supplied key/value data that does not need to conform to the corresponding NotificationChannelDescriptor's schema, unlike the labels field. This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the NotificationChannel objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.
            verification_status: |-
                -
                Indicates whether this channel has been verified or not. On a ListNotificationChannels or GetNotificationChannel operation, this field is expected to be populated.If the value is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed that the channel works.If the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification or that this specific channel has been exempted from verification because it was created prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This field cannot be modified using a standard UpdateNotificationChannel operation. To change the value of this field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.

                Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.
                You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
                Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
                destination location.
                Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
                location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
                endpoint from route information.
                If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
                multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
                destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
                interface.
                A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
                is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
                don't intend to test.
                Structure is documented below.

                Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
                You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
                (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
                source location.
                Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
                a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
                also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
                which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
                information.
                If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
                you must provide the destination VPC network.
                If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
                identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
                address or VPC network.
                A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
                ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
                you don't intend to test.
                Structure is documented below.
            source.instance: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                -
                (Optional)
                The IP address of the endpoint, which can be an external or
                internal IP. An IPv6 address is only allowed when the test's
                destination is a global load balancer VIP.
            source.network: |-
                -

                Possible values are GCP_NETWORK and NON_GCP_NETWORK.
            source.port: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The IP protocol port of the endpoint. Only applicable when
                protocol is TCP or UDP.
            source.project_id: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Project ID where the endpoint is located. The Project ID can be
                derived from the URI if you provide a VM instance or network URI.
                The following are two cases where you must provide the project ID:

                You may specify no more than one Google-managed public key.
                If you specify public_keys, you must specify at least one (1) key and may specify up to three (3) keys.
                Ed25519 public keys are not secret, and only allow Google to validate a request was signed by your corresponding private key.
                Ensure that the private key is kept secret, and that only authorized users can add public keys to a keyset.

                The resource name of the secret version must be in the format projects/*/secrets/*/versions/* where the * values are replaced by the secrets themselves.
                The secrets must be at least 16 bytes large.  The recommended secret size depends on the signature algorithm you are using.

                (Optional)
                The Origin resource to try when the current origin cannot be reached.
                After maxAttempts is reached, the configured failoverOrigin will be used to fulfil the request.
                The value of timeout.maxAttemptsTimeout dictates the timeout across all origins.
                A reference to a Topic resource.

                (Optional)
                Whether to replace all existing headers with the same name.
                By default, added header values are appended
                to the response or request headers with the
                same field names. The added values are
                separated by commas.
                To overwrite existing values, set replace to true.
            id: '- an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/locations/global/edgeCacheOrigins/{{name}}'

                Set of label tags associated with the EdgeCache resource.
            max_attempts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum number of attempts to cache fill from this origin. Another attempt is made when a cache fill fails with one of the retryConditions.
                Once maxAttempts to this origin have failed the failoverOrigin will be used, if one is specified. That failoverOrigin may specify its own maxAttempts,
                retryConditions and failoverOrigin to control its own cache fill failures.
                The total number of allowed attempts to cache fill across this and failover origins is limited to four.
                The total time allowed for cache fill attempts across this and failover origins can be controlled with maxAttemptsTimeout.
                The last valid, non-retried response from all origins will be returned to the client.
                If no origin returns a valid response, an HTTP 502 will be returned to the client.
                Defaults to 1. Must be a value greater than 0 and less than 4.
            name: |-
                -
                (Required)

                (Required)
                A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address reachable over the public Internet, or the address of a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
                This address will be used as the origin for cache requests - e.g. FQDN: media-backend.example.com, IPv4: 35.218.1.1, IPv6: 2607:f8b0:4012:809::200e, Cloud Storage: gs://bucketname
                When providing an FQDN (hostname), it must be publicly resolvable (e.g. via Google public DNS) and IP addresses must be publicly routable.  It must not contain a protocol (e.g., https://) and it must not contain any slashes.
                If a Cloud Storage bucket is provided, it must be in the canonical "gs://bucketname" format. Other forms, such as "storage.googleapis.com", will be rejected.

            origin_override_action.header_action: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The header actions, including adding and removing
                headers, for request handled by this origin.
                Structure is documented below.

                -
                (Optional)
                The URL rewrite configuration for request that are
                handled by this origin.

                are accepted.
            port: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The port to connect to the origin on.
                Defaults to port 443 for HTTP2 and HTTPS protocols, and port 80 for HTTP.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            protocol: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The protocol to use to connect to the configured origin. Defaults to HTTP2, and it is strongly recommended that users use HTTP2 for both security & performance.
                When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the protocol, a valid, publicly-signed, unexpired TLS (SSL) certificate must be presented by the origin server.
                Possible values are HTTP2, HTTPS, and HTTP.
            retry_conditions: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies one or more retry conditions for the configured origin.
                If the failure mode during a connection attempt to the origin matches the configured retryCondition(s),
                the origin request will be retried up to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if configured, will then be used to satisfy the request.
                The default retryCondition is "CONNECT_FAILURE".
                retryConditions apply to this origin, and not subsequent failoverOrigin(s),
                which may specify their own retryConditions and maxAttempts.
                Valid values are:
            timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The connection and HTTP timeout configuration for this origin.
                Structure is documented below.
            timeout.connect_timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum duration to wait for a single origin connection to be established, including DNS lookup, TLS handshake and TCP/QUIC connection establishment.
                Defaults to 5 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 15s.
                The connectTimeout capped by the deadline set by the request's maxAttemptsTimeout.  The last connection attempt may have a smaller connectTimeout in order to adhere to the overall maxAttemptsTimeout.
            timeout.max_attempts_timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum time across all connection attempts to the origin, including failover origins, before returning an error to the client. A HTTP 504 will be returned if the timeout is reached before a response is returned.
                Defaults to 15 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s.
                If a failoverOrigin is specified, the maxAttemptsTimeout of the first configured origin sets the deadline for all connection attempts across all failoverOrigins.
            timeout.read_timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum duration to wait between reads of a single HTTP connection/stream.
                Defaults to 15 seconds.  The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s.
                The readTimeout is capped by the responseTimeout.  All reads of the HTTP connection/stream must be completed by the deadline set by the responseTimeout.
                If the response headers have already been written to the connection, the response will be truncated and logged.
            timeout.response_timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum duration to wait for the last byte of a response to arrive when reading from the HTTP connection/stream.
                Defaults to 30 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 120s.
                The responseTimeout starts after the connection has been established.
                This also applies to HTTP Chunked Transfer Encoding responses, and/or when an open-ended Range request is made to the origin. Origins that take longer to write additional bytes to the response than the configured responseTimeout will result in an error being returned to the client.
                If the response headers have already been written to the connection, the response will be truncated and logged.
            update: '- Default is 60 minutes.'
            url_rewrite.host_rewrite: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Prior to forwarding the request to the selected
                origin, the request's host header is replaced with
                contents of the hostRewrite.
                This value must be between 1 and 255 characters.

                (Optional)
                Cache modes allow users to control the behaviour of the cache, what content it should cache automatically, whether to respect origin headers, or whether to unconditionally cache all responses.
                For all cache modes, Cache-Control headers will be passed to the client. Use clientTtl to override what is sent to the client.
                Possible values are CACHE_ALL_STATIC, USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, FORCE_CACHE_ALL, and BYPASS_CACHE.
            cdn_policy.client_ttl: |-

                -
                (Optional)

                Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin.
                Defaults to 86400s (1 day).
                Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTtl seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive.
            cdn_policy.negative_caching: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency.
                By default, the CDNPolicy will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:

                You must also set a signedRequestKeyset to enable signed requests.
                When set to REQUIRE_SIGNATURES, all matching requests will have their signature validated. Requests that were not signed with the corresponding private key, or that are otherwise invalid (expired, do not match the signature, IP address, or header) will be rejected with a HTTP 403 and (if enabled) logged.
                Possible values are DISABLED, REQUIRE_SIGNATURES, and REQUIRE_TOKENS.

                of a Linux operating system running within the instance.
                This name can be used to reference the device for mounting,
                resizing, and so on, from within the instance.
                If not specified, the server chooses a default device name
                to apply to this disk, in the form persistent-disk-x, where

                (Optional)
                Input only. Specifies the parameters for a new disk that will
                be created alongside the new instance. Use initialization
                parameters to create boot disks or local SSDs attached to the
                new instance. This property is mutually exclusive with the
                source property; you can only define one or the other, but not
                both.

            rules.condition: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A condition which determines whether this rule is used in the evaluation of the policy. When set, the expression field in the `Expr' must include from 1 to 10 subexpressions, joined by the "||" or "&&" operators. Each subexpression must be of the form "resource.matchTag('/tag_key_short_name, 'tag_value_short_name')". or "resource.matchTagId('tagKeys/key_id', 'tagValues/value_id')". where key_name and value_name are the resource names for Label Keys and Values. These names are available from the Tag Manager Service. An example expression is: "resource.matchTag('123456789/environment, 'prod')". or "resource.matchTagId('tagKeys/123', 'tagValues/456')".

                -
                An opaque tag indicating the current version of the Policy, used for concurrency control. This field is ignored if used in a CreatePolicy request. When the Policy is returned from either a GetPolicy or a ListPolicies request, this etag indicates the version of the current Policy to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the Policy is returned from a GetEffectivePolicy request, the etag will be unset.
            spec.inherit_from_parent: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Determines the inheritance behavior for this Policy. If inherit_from_parent is true, PolicyRules set higher up in the hierarchy (up to the closest root) are inherited and present in the effective policy. If it is false, then no rules are inherited, and this Policy becomes the new root for evaluation. This field can be set only for Policies which configure list constraints.
            spec.reset: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Ignores policies set above this resource and restores the constraint_default enforcement behavior of the specific Constraint at this resource. This field can be set in policies for either list or boolean constraints. If set, rules must be empty and inherit_from_parent must be set to false.
            spec.rules: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Up to 10 PolicyRules are allowed. In Policies for boolean constraints, the following requirements apply: - There must be one and only one PolicyRule where condition is unset. - BooleanPolicyRules with conditions must set enforced to the opposite of the PolicyRule without a condition. - During policy evaluation, PolicyRules with conditions that are true for a target resource take precedence.
            spec.update_time: |-
                -
                Output only. The time stamp this was previously updated. This represents the last time a call to CreatePolicy or UpdatePolicy was made for that Policy.

            assignment: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Specifies the VM instances that are assigned to this policy. This allows you to target sets
                or groups of VM instances by different parameters such as labels, names, OS, or zones.
                If left empty, all VM instances underneath this policy are targeted.
                At the same level in the resource hierarchy (that is within a project), the service prevents
                the creation of multiple policies that conflict with each other.
                For more information, see how the service
                handles assignment conflicts.
                Structure is documented below.

                for example "env=prod or env=staging".
                Structure is documented below.
            assignment.instance_name_prefixes: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Targets VM instances whose name starts with one of these prefixes.
                Like labels, this is another way to group VM instances when targeting configs,
                for example prefix="prod-".
                Only supported for project-level policies.
            assignment.instances: |-
                -

                zones/[ZONE]/instances/[INSTANCE_NAME].
                Instance targeting is uncommon and is supported to facilitate the management of changes
                by the instance or to target specific VM instances for development and testing.
                Only supported for project-level policies and must reference instances within this project.

            rollout.disruption_budget: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The maximum number (or percentage) of VMs per zone to disrupt at any given moment. The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up.
                During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps.
                A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget.
                For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone.
                For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.
                Structure is documented below.

                -
                (Required)
                When true, publishes each CertificateAuthority's CA certificate and includes its URL in the "Authority Information Access"
                X.509 extension in all issued Certificates. If this is false, the CA certificate will not be published and the corresponding
                X.509 extension will not be written in issued certificates.

                When true, publishes each CertificateAuthority's CRL and includes its URL in the "CRL Distribution Points" X.509 extension
                in all issued Certificates. If this is false, CRLs will not be published and the corresponding X.509 extension will not
                be written in issued certificates. CRLs will expire 7 days from their creation. However, we will rebuild daily. CRLs are
                also rebuilt shortly after a certificate is revoked.

        description: Certificate Authority Service provides reusable and parameterized templates that you can use for common certificate issuance scenarios. A certificate template represents a relatively static and well-defined certificate issuance schema within an organization.  A certificate template can essentially become a full-fledged vertical certificate issuance framework.

                This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
                before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
                delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
                acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
                again during that time (on a best-effort basis).
                For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
                the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
                subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
                pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
                maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
                If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.
                For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
                for the call to the push endpoint.
                If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
                will eventually redeliver the message.

                (Optional)
                If delivery to BigQuery is used with this subscription, this field is used to configure it.
                Either pushConfig or bigQueryConfig can be set, but not both.
                If both are empty, then the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods.

                this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering
                is disabled.
                The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscription's
                parent project (i.e.,
                service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
                permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.

                The name of the topic to which dead letter messages should be published.
                Format is projects/{project}/topics/{topic}.
                The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with the enclosing subscription's
                parent project (i.e.,
                service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
                permission to Publish() to this topic.
                The operation will fail if the topic does not exist.
                Users should ensure that there is a subscription attached to this topic
                since messages published to a topic with no subscriptions are lost.

                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value must be
                between 5 and 100.
                The number of delivery attempts is defined as 1 + (the sum of number of
                NACKs and number of times the acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message).
                A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that
                client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines.
                This field will be honored on a best effort basis.
                If this parameter is 0, a default value of 5 is used.

                If true, messages published with the same orderingKey in PubsubMessage will be delivered to
                the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they
                may be delivered in any order.
            expiration_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.
                A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber
                is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
                operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default
                policy with ttl of 31 days will be used.  If it is set but ttl is "", the
                resource never expires.  The minimum allowed value for expirationPolicy.ttl
                is 1 day.
                Structure is documented below.
            expiration_policy.ttl: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Specifies the "time-to-live" duration for an associated resource. The
                resource expires if it is not active for a period of ttl.
                If ttl is not set, the associated resource never expires.
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'.
                Example - "3.5s".

                -
                (Optional)
                The subscription only delivers the messages that match the filter.
                Pub/Sub automatically acknowledges the messages that don't match the filter. You can filter messages
                by their attributes. The maximum length of a filter is 256 bytes. After creating the subscription,
                you can't modify the filter.

            message_retention_duration: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
                backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
                retain_acked_messages is true, then this also configures the retention
                of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a
                subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more
                than 7 days ("604800s") or less than 10 minutes ("600s").
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated

            oidc_token.audience: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim
                identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The audience
                value is a single case-sensitive string. Having multiple values (array)
                for the audience field is not supported. More info about the OIDC JWT
                token audience here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3
                Note: if not specified, the Push endpoint URL will be used.
            oidc_token.service_account_email: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Service account email to be used for generating the OIDC token.
                The caller (for subscriptions.create, subscriptions.patch, and
                subscriptions.modifyPushConfig RPCs) must have the
                iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            push_config: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to
                configure it. An empty pushConfig signifies that the subscriber will
                pull and ack messages using API methods.
                Structure is documented below.
            push_config.attributes: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Endpoint configuration attributes.
                Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
                be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.
                The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
                can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
                attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
                the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
                (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
                based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.
                If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
                it will default to the version of the API used to make
                such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
                call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
                calls will always return a valid version, even if the
                subscription was created without this attribute.
                The possible values for this attribute are:
            push_config.oidc_token: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT token as
                an Authorization header in the HTTP request for every pushed message.
                Structure is documented below.
            push_config.push_endpoint: |-
                -
                (Required)
                A URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed.
                For example, a Webhook endpoint might use
                "https://example.com/push".
            retain_acked_messages: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then
                messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if
                they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
                messageRetentionDuration window.
            retry_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription.
                If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers.
                RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message
                Structure is documented below.
            retry_policy.maximum_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds.
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".
            retry_policy.minimum_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".

                For instance, it allows any attached subscription to seek to a timestamp
                that is up to messageRetentionDuration in the past. If this field is not

                - The private key in JSON format, base64 encoded. This is what you normally get as a file when creating
                service account keys through the CLI or web console. This is only populated when creating a new key.
            private_key_type: (Optional) The output format of the private key. TYPE_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE is the default output format.
            public_key: '- The public key, base64 encoded'
            public_key_data: (Optional) Public key data to create a service account key for given service account. The expected format for this field is a base64 encoded X509_PEM and it conflicts with public_key_type and private_key_type.
            public_key_type: (Optional) The output format of the public key requested. TYPE_X509_PEM_FILE is the default output format.
            service_account_id: |-
                - (Required) The Service account id of the Key. This can be a string in the format
                {ACCOUNT} or projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}. If the {ACCOUNT}-only syntax is used, either
                the full email address of the service account or its name can be specified as a value, in which case the project will
                automatically be inferred from the account. Otherwise, if the projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}
                syntax is used, the {ACCOUNT} specified can be the full email address of the service account or the service account's
                unique id. Substituting - as a wildcard for the {PROJECT_ID} will infer the project from the account.
            valid_after: '- The key can be used after this timestamp. A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, accurate to nanoseconds. Example: "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".'

At most one entry is allowed per metric. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is above 0, the autoscaling will be based on both CPU utilization and accelerator's duty cycle metrics and scale up when either metrics exceeds its target value while scale down if both metrics are under their target value. The default target value is 60 for both metrics. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is 0, the autoscaling will be based on CPU utilization metric only with default target value 60 if not explicitly set. For example, in the case of Online Prediction, if you want to override target CPU utilization to 80, you should set autoscaling_metric_specs.metric_name to aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization and autoscaling_metric_specs.target to 80.
